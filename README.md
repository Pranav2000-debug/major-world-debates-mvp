# Debatrium

AI-native document analysis and debate generation platform.

Debatrium is a full-stack web application that transforms complex documents into **structured summaries and debates** using modern AI techniques. The system is designed with a strong focus on **architecture, scalability, and real-world production concerns**, not just model calls.

---

## 🚀 What Debatrium Does

- Accepts PDF documents from users
- Analyzes content using AI
- Produces structured summaries and debate-style insights
- Designed to evolve toward **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for grounded, source-aware outputs

This project demonstrates how AI systems behave beyond demos — when security, infrastructure, and cost matter.

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Most AI projects stop at:
> “Send text to an LLM and display the answer.”

Debatrium goes further by focusing on:
- System design around AI workloads
- Production-ready backend patterns
- Clean separation between AI logic and application delivery
- Preparing the architecture for embeddings, vector search, and async workflows

---

## 🏗️ Key Engineering Highlights

- **End-to-end system**: frontend, backend, AI pipeline, and deployment
- **Production-minded backend**: authentication, abuse prevention, and defensive data handling
- **AI pipeline**: structured outputs, lifecycle tracking, and debate generation
- **Deployment-ready**: containerized application with CI in place

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Embeddings over document content
- Vector search for grounded responses
- Async processing for scalable AI workflows

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB
- AI: LLM-based analysis (RAG planned)
- Infrastructure: Docker, NGINX, GitHub Actions

---

## 📌 What This Demonstrates

- Full-stack engineering with AI systems
- Backend and infrastructure awareness
- Architectural thinking beyond CRUD apps
- Willingness to refactor and build correctly

---

## ⚠️ Status

This project is actively evolving and being built in public.  
Architecture and correctness are prioritized over polish.
